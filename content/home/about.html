<p>Hi, my name is Nathan Broadbent and I'm a software developer from Auckland, New Zealand. 
I've been writing web, mobile, and desktop applications professionally
<noscript>since 2009.</noscript>
<script>document.write("for " + (new Date().getFullYear() - 2009) + " years.");</script>
I especially enjoy working with startups and building my own products.</p>

<p>I've worked with many different tools and technologies, including 
Ruby on Rails, Go, Java, Python, React, Ember.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, C, C++, 
Objective-C, Swift, React Native, and many others. 
I like to stay sharp and I'm always learning new things. I also have experience with DevOps
and have worked with many different tools over the years, including AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku, 
Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Convox, Ansible, Chef, etc.</p>

<p>I received an
