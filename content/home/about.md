# I build apps

I'm a **full-stack** software developer. I started building web applications with **Ruby on Rails** in 2009. I enjoy working on **web apps**, **mobile apps**, **dev-ops**, and **embedded software** for **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino**. I also have experience **working remotely** on distributed teams.

I may be available to work on your project. Please [contact me](#contact) for rates and availability.
