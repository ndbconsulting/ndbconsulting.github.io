# I build apps

I'm a **full-stack** software developer. I started building web applications with **Ruby on Rails** in 2009. I enjoy working on **web apps**, **mobile apps**, **dev-ops**, and **embedded software** for **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino**. I also have experience **working remotely** on distributed teams.

I have qualified for an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement" target="_blank">O-1 visa</a>, and I passed the <a href="https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent" target="_blank">Toptal screening process</a>.

I also have some experience with design (Sketch and Photoshop), video editing (Premiere Pro, After Effects), music recording and production (Logic Pro, REAPER, ProTools). I enjoy acting, improv, juggling 5 balls, doing kickflips on a skateboard, backflips on a snowboard, jumping off buildings, and falling down stairs (i.e. stunt work).

I'm looking for interesting projects to work on. Let me know if you have an idea for a website, mobile game, short film, or if you want to start a live electro-swing band. [Contact me](#contact) for availability and rates.
