Hello! I'm a software developer. I build web apps with tools such as Rails, Node.js, Elixir, React, and Ember. I also build cross-platform mobile apps with React Native (including native code in Swift, Objective C, Java, and C#).

I enjoy working on DevOps (AWS, Hashicorp tools, Kubernetes, Chef, Ansible), and embedded software for the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I like to work remotely on distributed teams.

I have qualified for an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">O-1 visa</a>, and passed the <a href="https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toptal screening process</a>.

I might be available to work on your project. Please [contact me](#contact) for availability and rates.
