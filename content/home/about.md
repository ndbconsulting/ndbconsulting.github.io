# I build apps

I'm a **full-stack** software developer. I started building web applications with **Ruby on Rails** in 2009. I enjoy working on **web apps**, **mobile apps**, **dev-ops**, and **embedded software** for **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino**. I enjoy **working remotely** on distributed teams.

I have qualified for an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement" target="_blank">O-1 visa</a>, and I passed the <a href="https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent" target="_blank">Toptal screening process</a>.

I have some experience with design, video editing, and music recording and production. Some of my other interests include improv, acting, visual effects, 3D animation, juggling, skateboarding, and skiing.

I'm looking for interesting projects to work on. Let me know if you have an idea for a website, mobile game, short film, or if you want to start a live electro-swing band.
<br/>[Contact me](#contact) for availability and rates.
