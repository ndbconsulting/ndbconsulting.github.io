Hello! I'm a **full-stack** software developer. I enjoy building web apps with tools such as Rails, Node.js, Elixir, React, and Ember. I also enjoy building cross-platform mobile apps with React Native (including native code in Swift, Objective C, Java, and C#).

I also enjoy working on **devops** (e.g. AWS, [Hashicorp tools](https://www.hashicorp.com/), Kubernetes), and **embedded software** for the **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino**. I prefer to **work remotely** on distributed teams.

I have qualified for an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement" target="_blank">O-1 visa</a>, and I have passed the <a href="https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent" target="_blank">Toptal screening process</a>.

I might be available to work on your project. Please [contact me](#contact) for availability and rates.
