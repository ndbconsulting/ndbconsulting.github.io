# I build apps

I'm a **full-stack** software developer. I started building web applications with **Ruby on Rails** in 2009. I enjoy working on **web apps**, **mobile apps**, **dev-ops**, and **embedded software** for **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino**. I enjoy **working remotely** on distributed teams.

I have qualified for an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement" target="_blank">O-1 visa</a>, and I passed the <a href="https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent" target="_blank">Toptal screening process</a>.

I'm looking for interesting projects to work on. [Contact me](#contact) for availability and rates.
